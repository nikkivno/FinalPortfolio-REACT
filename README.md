## Description

This website is a demonstration of my work as a coder thusfar. In the website viewers will see a blurb about me, both in terms of coding and personally, as well as a portfolio of some of my work, a link to my resume and a contact page where soon, they will be able to send me messages from the site. 

## Future Features

In the near future some features I would like to incorporate are: 

- Backend set up for the contact form
- Stylized cohesive images for all of the projects in the portfolio
- A custom domain name
